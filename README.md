# Welcome-Screen-Project

This project is meant to be a welcome screen that displays a bit of information and an encouraging quote.

Really this is just a project for me to play around with to make different API's work together. 

In the final stages of the project I would like to possibily have it set up on a small server that has all 
of the background photos stored, so the code does not constantly have to fetch from different URL's.

Thanks for Reading!

Note: Due to API subscription expiring, quotes no longer are shown.
